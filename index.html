        <h1>My Favorite hobby</h1>
        <h2>Playing Video Games</h2>
        <h3>My hobby is playing video games. It is fun to play all of these games from PC game store, iOS, android, and amazon! There is this game called King of Thieves. It is a game where you can beat levels, collect gems from gem mines, raiding dungeons and gems, and placing gems into totems and start a ritual with it. But this is not all about King of Thieves though. It is possible to create an online game. I use Brackets to make websites. You can check some of them out here: </h3>
